# ReinforcementLearning
Reinforcement Learning methods (Q-Learning) applied on example applications

Examples Implemented
======================================
1. simple_example contains a simple example for 6-node example with simple rewards and solved using Q-learning.
    - execute the code using run.py in it's directory

2. ttt_ql contains Q-learning example implemented on a game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a random player.
    - execute using run.py in the directory
    - pass an integer command line argument to define number of iterations. default is 1000.
